# MeshAdminNPMServer Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the MeshAdminNPMServer project to various environments. It covers setup instructions, environment configurations, and deployment steps to ensure a successful deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- Access to a GitHub account for repository management.
- PostgreSQL and Redis setup and running.
- Access to the production server environment.

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/MeshAdminNPMServer.git
   cd MeshAdminNPMServer
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   JWT_SECRET=<your_secret>
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Docker Configuration**
   - Ensure that your `docker-compose.yml` is properly set up for both development and production configurations. Modify environment variables as needed.

## Deployment Steps

### Local Development

1. **Start Docker Services**

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
   ```

2. **Access Application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost
   - Backend: http://localhost/api

### Production Deployment

1. **Build and Push Docker Images**

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-repo/backend:latest -f Dockerfile.backend .
   docker build -t your-repo/frontend:latest -f Dockerfile.frontend .
   docker push your-repo/backend:latest
   docker push your-repo/frontend:latest
   ```

2. **Deploy to Production**
   - Use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process. Refer to `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` for the CI/CD pipeline setup.

3. **Configure NGINX**
   Update `nginx.conf` to match your production needs and ensure proper routing of frontend and API requests.

4. **Post-Deployment Checks**
   - Verify all services are running as expected.
   - Check logs for any errors or warnings.
   - Run health checks to ensure all systems are operational.

## Health Checks and Monitoring

- Ensure `Docker` containers are monitored for performance and resource usage.
- Regularly update and fix any security vulnerabilities using tools like `Snyk` integrated into your CI/CD pipeline.

## Troubleshooting

- Refer to logs in the Docker containers for any deployment issues.
- Check environment variable configurations if services fail to start.
